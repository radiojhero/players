# RÃ¡dio J-Hero Embeddable Players

[![Dev dependencies status](https://david-dm.org/radiojhero/players/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/radiojhero/players?type=dev)

This repository is comprised of code powering the embeddable players. They are
all compiled to static assets, making them easy to be hosted almost anywhere.

If you're _simply interested in embedding a player_, you're at the wrong place.
Go for the [code generator at the main website][1] instead. Otherwise, if you
want to _help out with enhancements, bugfixes, or even contribute new players_,
then read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
